# BlueKnight - Stream 1 - Front End Development

## Deployment

This project was deployed through GitHub pages at https://sryan5966.github.io/blueknightt/#/

## About 

The name blueknight was generated with this website https://www.bandnamemaker.com/. This is a website to show the work (video and audio) of the band. All audio and video is work done by the band "The monkeys". 

## Tech Used

The project was made with these languages.

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- AngularJS

## Layout

I wanted to keep the layout as text free as possible. Because of this I relied heavily on the video, audio and imagery. Another way to keep text free design is the hover transitions on the imagies (in band info) and social icons (at the bottom of every page. 

## Issues Faced

1. Getting the pages to link up with each other.
2. Making the transitions for the social icons.
3. Deploying to GitHub pages. 
4. After deploying to GitHub pages the videos did not play, i got the video to play by linking them to youtube instead.
