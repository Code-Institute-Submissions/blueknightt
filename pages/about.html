							<h1>BLUE KNIGHTS</h1>
							
								<p>
								Blue Knights are an American-British pop rock band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series Blue Knights, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner. Dolenz described blue Knights as initially being "a TV show about an imaginary band ... that wanted to be The Beatles, [but] that was never successful".[1] The actor-musicians, however, soon became a real band.
